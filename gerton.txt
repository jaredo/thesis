Hi Jared,

Here's my list:

p.5 ...named Chiamante WHICH is available online
p.5 Loci specific --> Locus-specific
p.9 integral limits
p.12 P(Z_Y=1) =1 etc.
p.15 affect --> effect (& in some other placed; probably do search &  
replace)
p.17 equals one if THE i-th sequence ...
p.18 same thing
p.18 eq 2.8  L_4 has a slash through it
p.20 dependant --> dependent  (& in other placed: search & replace)
p.20 maybe add that you iterate these steps until convergence
p.36 fig 2.9: 100 - GCR%
p.63: labels X = {x_1, ... , x_l}  (not capital X_L).
p.63 ...now uniquely defines a haplotype that is consistent with G_i.   
Could that be "diplotype"?  In any way please mention that X  
determines TWO haplotypes, consistent with genotypes.
p.63 also mention that there is ONE sequence Z per haplotype, i.e. TWO  
per sequence X, and that this introduction of an additional nuisance  
variable is key to the method's fast inference
p.64 transition probability includes the emission probability as a  
term; H should be conditioned on.
p.64 emission probability likely wrong, as discussed (swap = and \neq;  
theta should probably include the mutation rate in some way)
p.64 indices in alpha_{l+1} etc. are off by one on this page and p.65
p.96 add ref to number 0.605

p.100 This highlights that WHILE both methods ...
p.107 Table 4.6 caption: last sentence needs period
p.107 why are the M duos more informative about corrections that the P  
duos?
p.110 FDR not FPR

p.111 Centre/Centre, and same axis label for centre & right
p.114 swapped paternal and maternal recombination rates in caption
p.115 explain the substantial peak in recomb in merlin-only sites

That was it from me!

Best wishes
Gerton
